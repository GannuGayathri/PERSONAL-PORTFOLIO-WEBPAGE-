# I created a Portfolio Website using HTML and CSS to showcase a developer’s projects and skills. In this project, I used HTML to create the structure of the website. It helped me organize different sections like “About Me,” “Projects,” “Skills,” and “Contact.” Each section is clearly defined so that visitors can quickly understand the information. Then, I used CSS to add styles and make the portfolio look attractive. CSS allowed me to design the layout, adjust colors, choose fonts, and make the site responsive so it can work on both computers and mobile devices.I worked on this project using Visual Studio Code, which made it easier to write and edit code.A portfolio website is very useful for students, professionals, and job seekers. It helps to present technical projects, personal achievements, and skills in a clear way. For a developer, it can act as proof of work while applying for internships, freelance opportunities, or full-time jobs. Instead of just listing skills on a resume, a portfolio allows employers to see actual projects and the way they were built. It also gives a personal touch, since developers can include their introduction and contact details.creating a Portfolio Website using HTML and CSS was a valuable experience. It not only strengthened my web development basics but also gave me a professional-looking platform where I can present my work.Working on this project helped me improve my knowledge of HTML tags, semantic elements, CSS properties, layouts, and responsive design techniques. I also learned the importance of making a website user-friendly and visually appealing. Even though this version of the portfolio was built with only HTML and CSS, it can be further improved in the future by adding JavaScript for interactivity, animations, or even backend technologies to handle forms and data.#
